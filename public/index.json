Designed architecture for and delivered multiple microservices. Researched suitable AWS services for our requirements e.g. DynamoDB, RDS, Kinesis, SWF, ElasticSearch, SQS, SNS, etc. Saved many man-months of team effort by proposing an Elastic Search based solution instead of a custom solution over DynamoDB for a search microservice. Made debugging latency issues simpler by introducing Zipkin distributed tracing. Made it easier to refactor, maintain and test UI code by migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript.
