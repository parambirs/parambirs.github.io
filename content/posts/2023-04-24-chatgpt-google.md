I am not sure how helpful ChatGPT will be for writing real world code. But it can be a great improvement over Google
when you are looking for a quick answer about things like regular expressions or Unix commands. Recently, I had to write a cron
expression for a task that repeats regularly, and I found that using ChatGPT was more convenient than Google.
