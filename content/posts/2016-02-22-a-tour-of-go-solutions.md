I spent the past weekend learning Go. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) is a great resource to quickly come up to speed with Go. It’s a very small language (the spec is only around 50 pages!) and is really easy to pick up if you are already familiar with languages like C, JavaScript, Java or C#. I really liked the exercises that were scattered around in the tour. The ones that I found interesting were:

- [rot13Reader](https://tour.golang.org/methods/23)
- [Equivalent Binary Trees](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/8)
- [Web Crawler (the most interesting one!)](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/10)

I’ve put up my solutions to all the exercises in a Github repository – https://github.com/parambirs/atourofgo-exercises. I’d be interested in seeing alternate solutions and discussing different approaches to solving these exercises in Go!
