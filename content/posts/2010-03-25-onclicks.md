summary: "XHTML mandates lowercase event handler names."
---

HTML is case-insensitive and therefore the casing of event handler names in your HTML documents is irrelevant. E.g. you can use `onclick`, `ONCLICK`, `onClick` or even `oNcLiCk` for your event handler name. However, XHTML is not so liberal and stipulates that all event handler names should be lowercase (e.g. `onclick=”…”`). Therefore, to make your HTML pages XHTML compliant, always use lowercase event handler names.
